Luganda Bible Scraper
=====================
This app scrapes the Luganda Bible available at these two locations:
1.  [Lutherans Online](http://www.lutheransonline.com/servlet/lo_ProcServ/dbpage=cge&gid=01211001361002498027487858&pg=00027000001073059075147237)

2.  [Luganda Ministry](http://www.lugandaministry.org/Bible.html)

The *Lutherans Online* Bible has some chapters that are not accessible, while it all the pages on *Luganda Ministry* work well. I discovered this latter one later; otherwise it would probably be the only one listed.

In order to scrape pages, their URLs should be passed into the program in order. The order is used to establish the books, chapters, and verses.
